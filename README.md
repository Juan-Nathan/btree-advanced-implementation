# ðŸŒ³ Advanced B-Tree with Order Statistics and Range Queries

This project implements a powerful and feature-rich **B-Tree** data structure in Python, extending the canonical CLRS version with advanced functionality such as:

- Efficient insertion, deletion, and search
- Order statistics
- Range queries
- Functional command-line interface (CLI)

The implementation maintains subtree sizes to support statistical queries and uses a traversal-optimized structure to enable fast in-range searches.

## Features

- **Insert/Delete/Search** in logarithmic time (`O(log n)`)
- **Order Statistics**:
  - `select(k)` returns the k-th smallest element
  - `rank(x)` returns the 1-based position of key `x`
- **Range Queries**:
  - `keys_in_range(min, max)` returns all keys between `min` and `max`
  - `primes_in_range(min, max)` finds all prime numbers in that range using the **Miller-Rabin** primality test
- Built-in CLI support for scripted input/output using text files

## Input Constraints

- All keys must be positive integers (â‰¥ 1).
- Keys must be distinctâ€”duplicates are automatically ignored.

## B-Tree Properties

- Balanced multi-way tree with minimum degree `t`
- **Keys per node**: at most`2t - 1`, at least `t - 1` for non-root nodes
- **Children per node**: `len(keys) + 1`
- **Height of tree**: `O(log n)`, where `n` is the total number of keys
- **Leaf nodes**: contain only keys (no children)
- **Internal nodes**: maintain subtree sizes for fast select/rank

## How to Run

You can run the B-Tree program directly from the command line using:
`python btree.py t keystoinsert.txt keystodelete.txt commands.txt`

Where:
- `t` is the minimum degree of the B-Tree (must be an integer â‰¥ 2)
- `keystoinsert.txt` contains positive integers to insert (one per line)
- `keystodelete.txt` contains keys to delete (one per line)
- `commands.txt` contains commands to query the tree (see below)

## Output

Results are written to a file named:
`output.txt`

Each line corresponds to one command from `commands.txt`.

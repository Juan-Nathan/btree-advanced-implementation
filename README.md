# ðŸŒ³ Advanced B-Tree with Order Statistics and Range Queries

This project implements a powerful and feature-rich **B-Tree** data structure in Python, extending the canonical CLRS version with advanced functionality such as:

- Order statistics
- Range queries
- A functional command-line interface (CLI)

The implementation maintains **subtree sizes** to support **efficient order statistics** and uses a **traversal-optimized structure** to enable **fast range queries**.

## Features

- **Insert/Delete/Search** in logarithmic time (`O(log n)`)
- **Order Statistics**:
  - `select(k)` â†’ the `k`-th smallest key
  - `rank(x)` â†’ the 1-based position of key `x`
- **Range Queries**:
  - `keys_in_range(x, y)` â†’ all keys between `x` and `y`
  - `primes_in_range(x, y)` â†’ all prime keys between `x` and `y` using the **Miller-Rabin** primality test
- Built-in CLI support for scripted input/output using text files

## Input Constraints

- All keys must be positive integers (â‰¥ 1).
- Keys must be distinctâ€”duplicates are automatically ignored.

## B-Tree Properties

In a B-Tree with minimum degree `t`:

- Each node contains at most `2t - 1` keys.
- Each non-root node contains at least `t - 1` keys.
- An internal node with `k` keys has exactly `k + 1` children.
- All leaf nodes appear at the same level (balanced) and have no children.
- The height of the tree is `O(log n)`, where `n` is the total number of keys.

## How to Run

You can run the B-Tree program directly from the command line:

`python btree.py t keystoinsert.txt keystodelete.txt commands.txt`

Where:

- `t` is the minimum degree of the B-Tree (must be an integer â‰¥ 2).
- `keystoinsert.txt` contains keys (positive integers) to insert (one per line).
- `keystodelete.txt` contains keys to delete (one per line).
- `commands.txt` specifies a sequence of commands to run on the tree (one per line).

Supported commands in `commands.txt`:

- `select k` returns the `k`-th smallest key; -1 if `k` exceeds the number of keys.
- `rank x` returns the 1-based position of key `x`; -1 if `x` does not exist.
- `keysInRange x y` returns all keys within `[x, y]`; -1 if there are none.
- `primesInRange x y` returns all prime keys within `[x, y]`; -1 if there are none.

## Output

Results are written to a file named `output.txt`.

Each line corresponds to one command from `commands.txt`.
